# 255 Lab 1 (data visualisation, clustering, classification trees)

My submission for the first DA lab for ENGSCI233. It's about analysing the Titanic dataset using basic
data science algorithms like k-means clustering and creating classification trees from a training set to 
predict future data attributes from a test set.

Everything should be viewed in the .md file (on GitHub). The lab specifications are shown in the PDF file.
